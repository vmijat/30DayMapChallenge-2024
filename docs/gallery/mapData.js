You’re trying to make a map of the Arctic region and suddenly there’s this large white dot. ⚪ Why? The Web Mercator projection typically truncates latitude at around 85.06° N and S. This truncation is necessary because beyond these latitudes, the distortion becomes so severe that the projection would fail to provide a meaningful representation of the Earth\'s surface. The poles, at 90° latitude, lie outside this truncated range, and hence, they cannot be accurately represented. To make accurate maps of the polar regions, we use special projections that are designed to handle these areas, like the Polar Stereographic projection. These projections don’t try to wrap the whole globe onto a flat surface but instead focus specifically on representing the areas near the poles in a way that keeps them from being overly distorted.',
